# <password-generator>

## Description

This web application is designed to generate a password based on user generated criterea.

I made this project for my coding bootcamp but I will likely continue to upgrade it
to increase the user-experience. The prompts and checks are a cool feature, but I would
like to have checkboxes for the conditions and maybe a slider for password length.

If users have difficulty coming up with a password, this generator alleviate that issue.


## Installation

Open the webpage, which is hosted via my GitHub: 
https://pakuhn93.github.io/password-generator/

## Usage

The user clicks the Generate Password button and a series of prompts will guide them through a series of prompts that will determine the password length and  what characters will be included in the password.
